#+TITLE: MiniZinc Input Data Schema

MiniZinc now [[https://www.minizinc.org/doc-2.5.5/en/spec.html#json-support][supports JSON]],
but I couldn't find an official schema. This will be my evolving attempt at one. PRs welcome.

* Development

I use record query to validate and format the yaml, with some light edits:

#+begin_src bash
rq -yY < schema.yaml | sponge schema.yaml
#+end_src

I use yajsv to validate example data against it

#+begin_src bash
yajsv -s schema.yaml example-data.json
#+end_src
